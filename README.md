# Risk-On / Risk-Off Decision Tree

## The Risk-On / Risk-Off Decision Tree is designed to guide traders in making informed sector-based long and short decisions, based on a systematic evaluation of premarket indicators and market seasonality. By analyzing these elements, the decision tree helps determine if the market environment favors a "Risk-On" or "Risk-Off" stance. The resulting posture then guides sector allocations, allowing the trader to strategically select stocks or baskets of stocks for both long and short positions in alignment with the broader market sentiment.

### Objectives
Identify Market Sentiment: Evaluate key premarket indicators and seasonality to categorize the market environment as either Risk-On, Risk-Off, or Neutral.
Sector Allocation Guidance: Use the decision treeâ€™s output to direct sector-based investments, advising on long/short positioning across sectors like Technology, Discretionary, Staples, and Healthcare.

### Premarket Indicators
This model leverages a diverse set of premarket indicators to gauge market sentiment. These indicators and their typical "Risk-On" and "Risk-Off" behaviors include:

#### OIL:
Risk-On: Price increases  
Risk-Off: Price decreases

#### VIX (Volatility Index):
Risk-On: Index declines  
Risk-Off: Index rises

#### TLT (20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF):
Risk-On: Price increases  
Risk-Off: Price decreases  

#### GOLD:
Risk-On: Price decreases  
Risk-Off: Price increases  

#### EUR/USD:
Risk-On: Pair increases  
Risk-Off: Pair decreases  

#### DXY (Dollar Index):
Risk-On: Index declines  
Risk-Off: Index rises  

#### SPY Premarket Move:
Evaluates both the direction (up/down) and magnitude of SPY's movement to contextualize overall market sentiment.  

### Decision Process
#### Evaluate Premarket Indicators: 
Assess each indicator individually for a Risk-On, Risk-Off, or neutral signal.

#### Determine Market Sentiment:
If a majority of indicators lean towards Risk-On or Risk-Off, classify the market as such.   
Mixed signals result in a "Neutral" market sentiment.

#### Check SPY Gap: 
Consider both direction and magnitude of the premarket gap in SPY.

#### RSI5 Technical Indicator on SPY: 
Analyze the RSI5 to understand if SPY is overbought, oversold, or neutral.

#### Incorporate Seasonality: 
Recognize historically bullish or bearish periods for added context.

### Market Postures
Based on the evaluation process, the decision tree directs traders towards one of several postures:

**Risk-On:** Sectors: Long Technology and Discretionary, short Staples and Healthcare. Weighting: Full exposure to long and short sectors.
**Moderate Risk-On:**  Same sector allocation as Risk-On, but with reduced position sizes.  
**Neutral:** No bias, no specific sector preference.  
**Risk-Off:** Sectors: Long Staples and Healthcare, short Technology and Discretionary. Weighting: Full exposure to long and short sectors.
**Moderate Risk-Off:** Same sector allocation as Risk-Off, but with reduced position sizes.    

### Goal and Usage
This decision tree provides a structured decision-making process that enables traders to align their investments with prevailing market conditions and tendencies. By following the flowchart, traders can make calculated, data-backed decisions about sector positioning to optimize for expected market conditions.
