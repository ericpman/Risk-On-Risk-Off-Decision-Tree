# Risk-On-Risk-Off-Decision-Tree
## The goal of this decision tree is to use a pool of premarket indicators and seasonality to determine if the market is leaning towards 'Risk On' factions in the market or 'Risk Off' factions. The goal is to help guide a trader through a decision making process in regards to the sectors he or she will choose to be long and/or short.

The premarket indicators we will use are OIL, VIX, TLT, GOLD, EURUSD, DXY, and the premarket move in SPY. We also factor in seasonality and a technical indicator called RSI5 on the SPY. The indicators are evaluated to determine if they are showing Risk on or Risk Off posturing. This is determined through the following means:
Risk On: Oil Up, VIX down, EURUSD up, DXY down, Gold down, TLT up.
Risk Off: Oil Down, VIX up, EURUSD down, DXY up, Gold up, TLT down. 

If the premarket indicators show mixed signals (i.e. there is no majority consensus on risk on or risk off) then we deem the premarket signals as being "neutral."
The next step would be determining whether the SPY (the S&P500 ETF) is gapping up or down, and the magnitude of the gap. 
After determining the gap and magnitude of gap, we then check the RSI5 on a daily level. Is the RSI5 overbought, oversold, or mixed? This is to determine a broader market perspective. Finally, we check seasonality. Are we in a historically bullish or bearish period in the markets? 

Our final determination boils down to seversal types of posturings we can take in the market.
Risk On = fully long stocks in sectors such as Technology and Discretionary, short stocks in sectors such as Staples and Healthcare.
Moderately Risk On = same as risk on, with a smaller weighting in the long/short sectors.
Neutral = no bias towards risk on or risk off sectors.
Risk Off = fully long stocks in sectors such as Staples and Healthcare, short stocks in Technology and Discretionary.
Moderately Risk off = same as risk off, with a smaller weighitng in the long/short sectors.

This flow chart is meant to give the trader a decision-making process that can help guide the stocks or basket of stocks they choose to go long or short based on the aforementioned premarket indicators and market activity.
